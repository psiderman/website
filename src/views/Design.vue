  <p>
    Quizizz is an online platform that helps teachers conduct assessments,
    instruction, and practice that motivate every student. It’s used by 80
    million+ educators and students around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I joined as Quizizz’s second designer, and worked with the team from 2019 to
    2023. I delivered countless quality of life enhancements, and below are some
    of the bigger projects I spearheaded, while leading the Design Systems, and
    Content Platform teams.
  </p>
  <h2>Question Types</h2>
  <p>
    At the time of writing this, there are sixteen ways to ask a question on
    Quizizz. Between 2021 and 2023, we added 12 new question types, of which I
    designed 9, and led the designs for 3 more.

  <h2>Design System</h2>
  <p>I am responsible forever, for the design system that I tamed</p>

  <h2>Lessons</h2>
  <p>
    What happens when you take informational slides and marry them with the
    interactivity of a quiz game? You kill ‘death by slides’. The sole two
    designers of Quizizz at the time delivered this 0→1 product in under four
    weeks.

  ></div>
  <h2>Motion and Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to delivering screens and flows, I often took to Codepen,
    Principle, and plain old Figma to create additional artifacts.
