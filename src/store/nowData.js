      `Moved back to Kolhapur and brought my PS5 with me. Thought I'd only spend
      a couple of weeks here, but it's been close to five. I made the mistake of
      teaching my parents poker using monopoly money and they're addicted to the
      game. We bought chips. They aren't gamblers so hopefully, they'll never
      play with real money.`,
      `The last few months have been a good break and a great change of scenery
      after working for five years non-stop. But a big part of my life has been
      my work, which is missing right now. I'm not quite ready to give that up
      just yet. I now find myself redoing my portfolio and applying for jobs
      again, with some excitement and loads of nervousness.`,
      `I also can't bring myself to focus on building a product from scratch at
      this point in life; not alone. So, I'm pressing pause on Kiwi as well.`,

      apartment would mean having to work through some uncomfortable thoughts?
      Not me!`,
